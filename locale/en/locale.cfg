rampant-evolution-evolutionPerUnitKilled=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by biter units being killed. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerHiveKilled=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by Rampant hives being killed. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerSpawnerKilled=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by spawners being killed. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerTileAbsorbed=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by pollution being absorbed by tiles. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerTreeDied=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by pollution damaging trees. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerTreeAbsorbed=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by pollution being absorbed by trees. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
